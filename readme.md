A light, super fast, and intuitive static build system made for front end development and building web apps.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then just run `npm install roots -g` and you'll be all set.

Usage
-----

Once you have roots installed, you can use the command line to wrangle your project. You must be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to be able to use roots. All the possible commands and options are explained clearly on the [man page](http://roots.cx/docs/man.html).
