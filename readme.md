A light, super fast, and intuitive static build system made for front end development and building web apps.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then just run `npm install roots -g` and you'll be all set.

##### OSX Installs
* If you encounter problems when installing. Please ensure Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools are Installed.
* From Xcode go to Preferences -> Download -> Command Line Tools -> Install to install command line tools.

##### Windows Installs
* If you encounter problems when installing. Please ensure [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), Python, and Visual C++ runtime executables are installed.
* You can install Windows Visual C++ components by doing any of the following: Installing Visual Studio 2005 or above, installing the .NET framework or manually adding it to your system PATH if it already exists on your machine.

Usage
-----

Once you have roots installed, you can use the command line to wrangle your project. You must be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to be able to use roots. All the possible commands and options are explained clearly on the [man page](http://roots.cx/docs/man.html).
